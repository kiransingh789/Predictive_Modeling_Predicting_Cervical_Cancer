## Project Objective
Our objective is to determine likelihood of biopsy results returning positive vs. negative results visa vie health screening data sample, thereby creating an ensuing model(s) to help determine the efficacy of reproducible tests of a similar fashion.

## Project Description
Data collected from biopsy results (positive or negative) from cervical cancer screening pool from a Venezuelan inpatient clinic. Multiple machine learning algorithms were implemented to determine whether individuals are more likely to be healthy (cancer free) or unhealthy(with positive biopsy results).
